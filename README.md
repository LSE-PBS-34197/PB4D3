Abstract

Suicide is one the most leading causes of death globally and a growing public health challenge. With the possibility that language usage of suicidal individuals is unique, this research aims to identify the impact of linguistic markers on suicide ideation, a primary step in the process of suicide. Social media and text analysis tools are leveraged to tackle biases in the current practices of suicide detection and overcome the limitation of an avenue to express suicide ideation. A total of 7098 suicide and non-suicide posts were randomly selected from reddit, a social media platform to compare differences in linguistic markers. A linear probability regression uncovered absolutism as a linguistic marker that increased the probability of suicide ideation by 13% (a = 5%). This result was robust to thematically dependent analysis and suggested a significant impact of mental health and negative emotions over suicide ideation. Comparing the results from inferential and thematic analysis reveals that the point estimate of absolutism is stable and consistently significant at a 5% level. Thus, Absolutism as a variable is robust and its usage in text impacts the likelihood of SI. Potential implications of the study include capitalising the impact of linguistic markers on suicide ideation to boost accuracy and precision of machine learning methods for suicide detection.
